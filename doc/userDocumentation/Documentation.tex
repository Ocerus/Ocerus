\chapter{Introduction}

This document serves as both user and design documentation for the Ocerus project. In this opening chapter the purpose of this project will be revealed, the structure of this document and the recommended way of reading it will be presented and finally the project architecture will be described.

\section{Purpose of this project}

The project Ocerus implements a multiplatform game engine and editor for creating simple 2.5D games. The main focus lies on the editing tools integrated to the engine. So, every change is immediately visible in the game context and can be tested in a real time. The engine takes care of rendering, physics, customization of game object behavior by scripts, resource management and input devices. It also provides a connection between the parts of the engine. The game objects are easily expandable using new components or scripts. Scripts themselves have access to other parts of the system.

\section{How to read this documentation}

Since this product is intended to be used by game developers rather than end users and because it is necessary to understand the common ways of developing more complex games the user documentation and the design documentation are merged into a single document. This section should help users of this product to orient in the document and let them know where the important information is located.

The first section that should be read before starting development of a new project is the section \ref{sec:editor-using}. It describes the basic work with the GUI of the editor -- how to create a new project, add a new scene, create entities and manipulate with them etc. For a change of a default entity behavior it is necessary to understand the associated script language syntax (\ref{sec:script-language}) and its functions and methods (\ref{sub:script-entity}, \ref{sub:script-systems} and \ref{sub:script-registered}). If some behavior cannot be added by scripts or it would be inefficient new components from which entities are built can be added, which is described in section \ref{sec:entity-extending}.

For adding a game menu or any text to the game the section \ref{sec:gui-creating} which explains the GUI creation. For a multilanguage support all texts in the game must not be hardcoded but the string system described in the chapter \ref{chap:string} should be used instead. If the game needs more advanced configuration see the section \ref{sec:config}. When a new native code is added it can be useful to log debug message (\ref{sec:logging}), profile the code (\ref{sec:profiling}), use helper classes (\ref{chap:utils}) and access the new code from scripts (\ref{sub:script-registering}).

\section{Project architecture}

The project Ocerus is logically divided into several relatively independent systems which cooperate with each other. Every system maintains its part of the application such as graphics, resources, scripts etc. and provides it to other ones. In the picture \ref{fig:system-connection} the relations among all systems are displayed with a brief description of what the systems provide to each other.

	\label{fig:system-connection}
\end{figure}

The project has not been created from scratch but it is based on several libraries to allow the developers to focus on important features for the end users and top-level design rather than low-level programming. All used libraries support many platforms, have free licenses and have been heavily tested in a lot of other projects. All of them are used directly by one to three subsystems except the library for unit testing. The library dependences of each system are displayed in the picture \ref{fig:library-dependence}.

\end{figure}

In this list a brief description of all used libraries is provided:

\begin{itemize}
  \item AngelScript -- a script engine with an own language
  \item Boost -- a package of helper data structures and algorithms
  \item Box2D -- a library providing 2D real-time physics
  \item CEGUI -- a graphic user interface engine
  \item DbgLib -- tools for a real-time debugging and crash dumps
  \item Expat -- a XML parser
  \item OIS -- a library for managing events from input devices
  \item OpenGL -- an API for 2D and 3D graphics
  \item RTHProfiler -- an interactive real-time profiling of code
  \item RudeConfig -- a library for managing configure files
  \item SDL -- a tool for an easier graphic rendering
  \item SOIL -- a library for loading textures of various formats
  \item UnitTest++ -- a framework for a unit testing
\end{itemize}

In the following chapters each of the project systems will be described from both the user and the design view. At the beginning of each chapter there is a section about a purpose of the described system and at the end of most chapters there is a small glossary of terms used in that chapter.
