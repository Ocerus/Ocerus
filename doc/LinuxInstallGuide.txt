Ocerus Linux Installation Instructions
**************************************

This document describes how to install Ocerus on linux system.

Manual compilation
******************

Unlike Ocerus Windows version, the Linux version compiles with shared system
libraries in mind. This however means that you need the following libraries in
the system:

* CEGUI-0.7.1 (http://www.cegui.org.uk)
* OIS-1.2.0 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/wgois)
* Boost-1.41.0 (http://www.boost.org)
* Expat-2.0.1 (http://expat.sourceforge.net)
* SDL-1.2 (http://www.libsdl.org)
* UnitTest++-1.4 (http://unittest-cpp.sourceforge.net)

All of these libraries are opensource and most of them are probably in your
distribution. You also need the following tools:
* GCC-4.4
* CMake-2.8

The following step-by-step guide is written for Ubuntu Linux 10.10:

1. Install necessary tools

sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake cmake-curses-gui

2. Install CEGUI
Unfortunatelly CEGUI in version 0.7.1 is not present in most of linux
distributions, so you need to compile it yourself. But first you need to
install CEGUI build dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libpcre3-dev libxml2-dev libglew15-dev libdevil-dev libpng-dev libmng-dev libxpm-dev libxcursor-dev libxxf86vm-dev

Then you need to extract CEGUI sources to a directory. You can find the
CEGUI-0.7.1.tar.gz file on the CD:

    tar xzf CEGUI-0.7.1.tar.gz
    cd CEGUI-0.7.1

After that you need to configure CEGUI with the following command:

    ./configure --enable-devil \
                --enable-libxml \
                --disable-tinyxml \
                --disable-expat \
                --disable-lua-module \
                --disable-ogre-renderer \
                --enable-opengl-renderer

If you do not want to install the application to system paths (and you
should not want to) you can define installation prefix with --prefix
parameter:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
                --enable-devil \
                --enable-libxml \
                --disable-tinyxml \
                --disable-expat \
                --disable-lua-module \
                --disable-ogre-renderer \
                --enable-opengl-renderer

Then just run:

    make
    make install

3. Install other dependencies

    sudo apt-get install libois-dev libboost-system-dev
    libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-regex-dev libexpat-dev libsdl1.2-dev libunittest++-dev

4. Compile OCERUS
Ocerus uses the CMake build system that allows to compile projects out of
sources, so your build directory is different than your source directory. So
first create your build directory.

    mkdir ocerus-build
    cd ocerus-build

Then you have to configure the project. The configuration process looks for
all the dependencies. If you installed CEGUI to a different directory, you
need to tell CMake about it. CEGUI uses pkg-config to propagate library
information so you need to setup PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable. For
instance, if your installation prefix was /usr/local, you need to set
PKG_CONFIG_PATH with the following command:

    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

After that you are ready to configure the project. Use path to ocerus source
dir as an argument to cmake command:

    cmake /mnt/cdrom/sources

If you want to change some build options, you can use ccmake command:

    ccmake /mnt/cdrom/sources

Finally type make:

    make

After the project was build, you can immediatelly run it by typing:

    ./ocerus-main
