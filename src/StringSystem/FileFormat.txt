# After key goes value (on the next line)
# Values can't normally start with ':' (however you can enclose such value into {- -} block

# Values can be multiline
# If you want to use multiline value, you have to enclose it with {- -},
# otherwise, empty lines will be ignored.

# Do not nest {- -}, parser won't load it correctly!

{-
The game is a 2D topdown massively multiplayer online tactical battleship
simulator with RPG elements. The game differs from other games in the
genre by the high rate of simulation. The game also allows players to use
their creativity to produce their ships and equipment from scratch and sell
it to other players.

The game retakes basics of its gameplay from Battleships Forever (1).
The game allows players to cooperate and play in parties by allowing them to
control specifc sections of one ship. This is to overcome issues of Battleships
Forever, whose gameplay is so fast that the player can't control the ship
effciently. This will also force players to cooperate with other players - thus
supporting the multiplayer spirit of the game.

# Remember to always add empty block to the end, to signalize end of file
# It makes implementation of parser easier, and 1 byte won't kill us
# However, file format will probably change over time
